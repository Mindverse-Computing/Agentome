# Agentome: A Multi-Agent AI Framework Using Mental Stress Tensors

The **Agentome** is an advanced AI framework that models the components of the human mind—such as Ego, Intellect, Memory, Sensory, and Action—using outputs from the Quantum Virtual Mind (QVM) framework. By leveraging the Mental Stress Tensor (MST), the Agentome simulates personalized cognitive and emotional states to enable real-time, adaptive AI systems.

---

## Overview

The **Agentome** represents the cognitive and emotional dynamics of an individual through multi-agent systems. Each agent corresponds to a specific component of the MST, capturing fluctuations in mental states derived from quantum simulations of the connectome. This framework is designed for applications in mental health, personalized AI, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems.

### Key Features:
1. Real-time mapping of cognitive and emotional states using MST.
2. Dynamic interaction among agents to simulate human-like mental processes.
3. Personalized AI for applications in mindfulness, therapy, and human-machine interaction.

## Components of the Agentome

### Logical Components:
1. **Ego**: Represents self-awareness and subjective identity.
2. **Memory**: Stores and retrieves past experiences.
3. **Intellect**: Facilitates reasoning and decision-making.
4. **Sensory**: Processes external stimuli and perceptual data.
5. **Action**: Executes cognitive decisions into physical responses.

### Inter-Agent Interactions:
- Each agent interacts dynamically, influenced by MST data.
- Simulates mental processes such as decision-making, focus, and emotional response.

## Workflow

1. **Input from MST**:
   - Use MST data derived from QVM simulations to initialize the Agentome.
   - Map the MST components (Ego, Intellect, etc.) to respective agents.

2. **Agent Configuration**:
   - Define each agent’s parameters based on MST fluctuations.
   - Establish interaction rules between agents.

3. **Real-Time Simulation**:
   - Simulate interactions among agents to reflect cognitive and emotional states.
   - Update agent states dynamically based on real-time MST input.

4. **Applications**:
   - Generate personalized mental health recommendations.
   - Enhance BCI systems by adapting to user-specific cognitive patterns.
